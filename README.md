|   1 | Count inversions and merge sort | Given an int array, merge sort (recursively) and count inversions. |
|   2 | Quick sort | An implementation of the quick sort algorithm with 3 different pivot selection methods. |
|   3 | Karger's random minimum cut | Implements undirected graphs (composed of vertexes and edges). Implements Karger's random minimum cut algorithm (randomly cut an edge until the graph is partitionned in 2). If the graph has n vertexes and the random min cut algorithm is run n^2 * log(n) times, the probability of NOT founding the minimum cut is inferior to 1/n. |
