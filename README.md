# BasicAlgorithms
A set of basic algorithms such as sorts, graphs searches...

| File ID    | Code |    Name    | Description |
| ------------- | --- | -------- | ---------- |
|   1 | Py | Count inversions and merge sort | Given an int array, merge sort (recursively) and count inversions. |
|   2 | Py | Quick sort | An implementation of the quick sort algorithm with 3 different pivot selection methods. |
|   3 | Py | Karger's random minimum cut | Implements undirected graphs (composed of vertexes and edges). Implements Karger's random minimum cut algorithm (randomly cut an edge until the graph is partitionned in 2). If the graph has n vertexes and the random min cut algorithm is run n^2 * log(n) times, the probability of NOT founding the minimum cut is inferior to 1/n. |
|   4 | C++ | Kosaraju's Algorithm | Strongly connected components in a directed graph. Implements Kosaraju's Two-Pass Algorithm, that computes the SCCs of a directed graph using two Depth-First Search loops. |
